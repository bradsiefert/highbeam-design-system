          To be honest I've found Bootstrap's spacers to be lacking. I need many more options than the few they 
          offered. I took their 6 spaces and increased it them to 12 which I've found dramatically helps the 
          flexibility of spacing elements.
        </p>

          These spacers can be used in the same way as Bootstrap's original spacers, on both margin and padding, 
          and can be used in single or multiple directions. Consult Bootstrap's spacing documentation for more 
          information about usage.
